                <br>
                <p>Photovoltaics is a technology that allows for environmentally safe conversion of solar energy into electricity. Photovoltaic installations allow for significant savings on electricity bills. The generated energy can be used on an ongoing basis, stored or resold to the power company.        Photovoltaic panels are one of the Renewable Energy Sources. These types of installations produce clean energy without polluting the environment. They also do not generate additional costs, which is an undoubted advantage in terms of investment.Solar panels are extremely durable and trouble-free. There is almost no risk of failure in the installation and their 100% service life is estimated at 25 years. After this period, the photovoltaic panels will still be in excellent condition and their efficiency will oscillate around 80%.</p>
