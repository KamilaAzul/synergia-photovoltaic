    <div class="whatIs-col">
    <p>Photovoltaics is a technology that allows for environmentally safe conversion of solar energy into electricity. 
    Photovoltaic installations allow for significant savings on electricity bills. The generated energy can be used on an ongoing basis, stored or resold to the power company.
    <br>
    Photovoltaic panels are one of the Renewable Energy Sources. These types of installations produce clean energy without polluting the environment. They also do not generate additional costs, which is an undoubted advantage in terms of investment.
    <br>
    Solar panels are extremely durable and trouble-free. There is almost no risk of failure in the installation and their 100% service life is estimated at 25 years. 
    After this period, the photovoltaic panels will still be in excellent condition and their efficiency will oscillate around 80%.</p>

        <div id="reasons_why">
        <ul>
        <li>Lower electricity bills</li><br>

        <p>Our electricity bills become lower thanks to the production of our own electricity from a photovoltaic installation, which gives us greater independence from electricity suppliers and from increases in energy prices, including the costs of its distribution.</p><br>

        <li>Publicly available source of energy for free</li><br>

        <p>Solar energy is a renewable energy source. This means you have unlimited access to it.</p><br>

                <ul>
                    <li>Ecological way of obtaining electricity</li><br>

                    <p>Low environmental impact. With constant electricity production, the installation does not interfere with the environment and does not produce substances harmful to humans and animals. It is not necessary to supply water for the proper functioning of the installation. It also does not produce precipitation, as silicon and aluminum are used for the production of photovoltaic modules, which are fully recyclable materials. Low sound level: the inverter produces a sound level of approx. 18-25 dB, which corresponds to a human whisper.</p><br>
            
                    <li>Co-financing for the installation and tax relief</li><br>
            
                    <p>Currently, it is possible to financially support the purchase and installation of photovoltaics in the form of subsidies, low-interest loans, loans with redemption, which are addressed to both individuals and companies.Photovoltaic panels can also be deducted from tax (as part of the thermomodernization relief), which allows you to get a refund of up to PLN 16,860.</p>
            
                    <li>You can use surplus electricity at a later date</li><br>
            
                    <p>The amount of energy produced in the summer period is much higher than in the autumn and winter period. The obtained surplus electricity can be transferred to the external power grid and collected during the period of reduced efficiency of solar panels.</p><br>
                    <li>Fast panel assembly and easy maintenance</li><br>
            
                    <p>Installation of a photovoltaic installation takes 2 to 3 days. The entire energy production and transmission process is fully automated. In case of any problem, the inverter included in the installation is able to notify us about it. The installation in an inclined position is cleaned by rain, but if necessary, you can do it yourself without the need to hire specialists.</p></ul>

<h3>Various aid programs have been operating in Poland for many years. Importantly, there are subsidies that will cover up to 60% of the costs of a  photovoltaic installation. </h3>
<br>

<h4>The following components affect the installation cost:</h4>
<br>
<ul>
<li> The quality of the components used</li>
<br>
<li>Installation power</li>
<br>
<p>The higher the installation power, the lower the price per 1 kWp</p>
<br>
<li> Installation location</li> 
<br>
<p>Ground-level installations are more expensive than those installed on the roof because they require special racks on which the panels will be mounted.<br>

<li>The costs of the assembly itself</li>
<br>
<p>The cost of photovoltaics is given per 1 kWp (kilowatt of installed power). In the case of micro-installations with a capacity of up to 10 kWp, 1 kWp costs PLN 4,500-5,500. So you can assume that a 4 kWp installation will cost you about PLN 20,000 (+/- 10%).</p>
