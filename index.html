                <h1>PHOTOVOLTAICS - WHAT IS IT?</h1>
                <br>
                    <p>Photovoltaics is a technology that allows for environmentally safe conversion of solar energy into electricity. Photovoltaic installations allow for significant savings on electricity bills. The generated energy can be used on an ongoing basis, stored or resold to the power company.

                        Photovoltaic panels are one of the Renewable Energy Sources. These types of installations produce clean energy without polluting the environment. They also do not generate additional costs, which is an undoubted advantage in terms of investment.Solar panels are extremely durable and trouble-free. There is almost no risk of failure in the installation and their 100% service life is estimated at 25 years. After this period, the photovoltaic panels will still be in excellent condition and their efficiency will oscillate around 80%.</p>

<h1>Installation and equipment cost</h1>
<p>Various aid programs have been operating in Poland for many years. Importantly, there are subsidies that will cover up to 60% of the costs of a 
     photovoltaic installation.
    
    
    The following components affect the installation cost:
    
    The quality of the components used;
    
    Installation power – the higher the installation power, the lower the price per 1 kWp;
    
    Installation location – ground-level installations are more expensive than those installed on the roof, because they require special racks on which the panels will be mounted;
    
    The costs of the assembly itself;
    
    The cost of photovoltaics is given per 1 kWp (kilowatt of installed power). In the case of micro-installations with a capacity of up to 10 kWp, 1 kWp costs PLN 4,500-5,500. So you can assume that a 4 kWp installation will cost you about PLN 20,000 (+/- 10%).
